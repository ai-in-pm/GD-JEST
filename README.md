# JEST Property-Based Testing Enhancement

This repository contains an enhancement for DeepMind's JEST (Just Enough Semantic Typing) framework, implementing property-based testing for mathematical functions.

Inspired by the paper "Data curation via joint example selection further accelerates multimodal learning".  To read the paper visit https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17711.
